## store pinia✨
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)</br>
Pinia started as an experiment to redesign what a Store for Vue could look like with the Composition API around November 2019. Since then, the initial principles are still the same, but Pinia works for both Vue 2 and Vue 3 and doesn't require you to use the composition API. The API is the same for both except for installation and SSR, and these docs are targeted to Vue 3 with notes about Vue 2 whenever necessary so it can be read by Vue 2 and Vue 3 users!

## Plugin pinia-plugin-persist✨

- [Pinia-Plugin-Persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pinia-plugin-persist)</br>
Persist VueJs Pinia state data in sessionStorage or other storages, heavilly influenced by vuex-persistedstate.
